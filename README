Everything has been correctly implemented.

Significant departures from design: 

Architecture:
	um:
		reads the file and sends the instructions to process.
	process:
		Process contains the abstraction for registers and is
		responsible for running the instructions. It interfaces
		with seg_mem.
	seg_mem:
		Seg_mem is the abstraction of the segmented memory. The
		segmented  memory is made out of a sequence of sequences
		containing instructions as uint32_t's. It handles operations
		such as mapping and unmapping of segments, in addition to
		secret operations like remapping segments.

Our UM can execute 50 million instructions in:

Unit tests:
	add.um
	cmov.um
	div.um
	halt.um
	halt-verbose.um
	loadprog.um
	map_unmap.um
	mult.um
	nand.um
	output.um
	print-six.um
	sstore-sload.um
